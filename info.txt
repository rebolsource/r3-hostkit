REBOL 3 Host-Kit Source Distribution
From REBOL Technologies in Ukiah, California

    Version: 2.100.104.0.0  (alpha)
    Updated: 26-Aug-2010/20:41:49-7:00 

The purpose of the R3 Host-Kit is to provide developers with a method of
building custom versions of REBOL, including built-in extension modules.

The license for the R3 Host-Kit is free for commercial, educational, and
hobby uses with "free" meaning "no charge" for such usage. However,
there are a few minor restrictions, so please read this document:

    http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/concepts/host-kit.html

Also, if you make a useful addition to R3, please consider publishing it
to the REBOL community. It's a good way to get others involved and it helps
promote the REBOL zen way of programming.

NOTE: To build R3, you need a copy of rebol.exe in your build directory.

Enjoy the Host-Kit,

-Carl
