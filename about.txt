PURPOSE:

The purpose of the R3 Host-Kit is to provide developers with a method of
building custom versions of REBOL, including built-in extension modules.

FEEDBACK:

R3 Chat is the forum for comments, feedback, code changes, and questions.
Type "chat" at the R3 command line. Most users only need to know about
five commands. Type "help" for doc pages, and "?" for a summary.

HOW TO BUILD:

We have included project makefiles for various tool-chains as make-name
directories. Some of these can be run directly from their directories.
Others may require you to move their files to the top directory.

For some types of builds, you need rebol.exe in your build directory.

That's it for now. Be productive, lean, and quick,

-Carl
